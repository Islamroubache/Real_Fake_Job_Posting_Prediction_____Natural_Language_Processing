## üìã Overview

Job Posting Fraud Detector is a Flask-based web application that leverages machine learning to analyze job postings and detect potential fraud. Using NLP techniques and ensemble learning methods, the system achieves high accuracy in identifying suspicious job listings, helping job seekers avoid scams.

### ‚ú® Key Features

- **Real-time Analysis** - Instant fraud detection on job posting submissions
- **High Accuracy** - Trained on 18,000+ real job postings with 97%+ accuracy
- **NLP-Powered** - Advanced text processing using TF-IDF vectorization
- **RESTful API** - Easy integration with existing platforms
- **Explainable Results** - Confidence scores and feature importance
- **Lightweight** - Fast predictions with optimized model architecture

## ü§ñ How It Works

### Machine Learning Pipeline

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Text cleaning and normalization
   - Feature extraction from job descriptions
   - Handling missing values and outliers

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - TF-IDF vectorization of text content
   - Extraction of metadata features (salary, location, company profile)
   - Binary encoding of categorical variables

3. **Model Training**
   - Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier
   - Training set: 18,000+ labeled job postings
   - Cross-validation for optimal hyperparameters
   - Performance: 97%+ accuracy, 95%+ F1-score

4. **Prediction**
   - Real-time text vectorization
   - Ensemble prediction with confidence scoring
   - Result interpretation and explanation
